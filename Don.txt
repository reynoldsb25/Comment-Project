This semester in Computer Science 1 we have covered many topics. After learning each topic the students then used that knowledge to solve multiple questions in a problem set. Then after mastering the new skills the students would take a written test, challenging them to code in a new way. Everyday students come to class ready to learn new concepts which can be used to solve real world problems.

Don has fantastic participation and is very motivated. Every day he comes to class ready to learn, and challenges the students around him. Don gets all of the work done and occasionally does extra work. He has missed 1 or 2 classes, and he always tells me when he won't be there.

Don has been performing well on our tests. He has completed all problem sets this year. Don has been doing really well this year. He currently has an A in the class.
