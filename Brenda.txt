Brenda's D block comments:

This semester in Computer Science 1 we have covered many topics. After learning each topic the students then used that knowledge to solve multiple questions in a problem set. Then after mastering the new skills the students would take a written test, challenging them to code in a new way. Everyday students come to class ready to learn new concepts which can be used to solve real world problems.

Brenda has bad participation and is not motivated. I feel that she comes to class not ready to learn and distracts the students around her. Brenda rarely gets work done, and forgets to submit homework and problem sets. She has missed 1 or 2 classes, and she always tells me when she won't be there.

Brenda needs to study more for tests. She has not been doing well on problem sets. Brenda needs to start performing better. She currently has a C- in the class.
