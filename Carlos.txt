Carlos's G block comments:

This semester in Computer Science 1 we have covered many topics. After learning each topic the students then used that knowledge to solve multiple questions in a problem set. Then after mastering the new skills the students would take a written test, challenging them to code in a new way. Everyday students come to class ready to learn new concepts which can be used to solve real world problems.

Carlos has good participation and is very motivated. Every day he comes to class and does his work efficiently. Carlos gets all of the work done and occasionally does extra work. He has missed 1 or 2 classes, and he always tells me when he won't be there.

Carlos has performed pretty average on tests. He has not been doing well on problem sets. Carlos needs to start performing better. He currently has a C in the class.
